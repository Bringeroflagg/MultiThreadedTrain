MTS is designed to manage train scheduling and dispatch using multithreading. It leverages the PThread library for concurrency, employing mutex and conditions to orchestrate train threads.
Using priority linked list queue.

Step 1. $ make

Step 2. $ ./mts test1.txt

Internal Logic Overview
1. Open File & Create Queue Mutex

  - The program opens the specified input file (e.g., test1.txt) and creates a mutex to ensure that only one train is added to the queue at a time.
2. Read Train Data

  - Uses fscanf to read each trainâ€™s direction, loading time, and crossing time from the file.
3. Create Nodes & Threads

  - For each set of train data, the program creates a new node and spawns a new train thread (handled in the train method).
4. Create Dispatcher Thread

  - After all train threads are created, the program starts a dedicated dispatcher thread.
6. Dispatcher Broadcast

  - The dispatcher sends a broadcast signal to all train threads to begin their loading phase.
7. Priority Queue Monitoring

  - The dispatcher continuously checks whether the priority queue contains pending trains.
8. Conditional Signaling

  - When a train is ready for processing, the dispatcher sends a conditional signal so the corresponding thread can run and complete its task.
9. Completion & Dispatcher Exit

  - After all trains have been processed and the queue is empty, the dispatcher thread finishes and returns control to main.
10. Thread Cleanup

  - The main thread rejoins the dispatcher thread and closes any remaining mutexes.
11. Program Exit

  - Once all threads complete and resources are released, the program terminates.
